## ⚙️ How to Install

1. First install the latest python3 from [www.python.org](www.python.org) 
2. Download/Clone the Rembg-Fuse Repo
3. Paste the `Rembg` folder in the fuse plugin directory of Resolve. [Know How](https://youtube.com/shorts/OFHyc48WOqc?feature=shared)
4. Follow the Rembg setup, either using `rembg_manager.py` or install manually.
5. Open the Fusion page in DaVinci Resolve
6. Search for the Rembg plugin in the node menu (_Shift+Spacebar_)
7. Connect the rembg node with any footage
8. Select the model and let the plugin do its work
9. The output will be displayed through the media out (if connected)
    
### ⮞ Automatic Setup for beginners [[Rembg_Manager](https://github.com/Akascape/Rembg-Fuse/blob/main/Rembg/rembg_manager.py)]
An easy-to-use Python application has been developed to simplify the Rembg setup. Just open the `rembg_manager.py` file—either directly in Python or via the Fuse interface — and follow the installation steps.

<summary><span style="font-size:1.25em"><strong>Or Setup Manually</strong></span></summary>
   
<br> If you encounter any error or prefer to manually install Rembg and its models, follow the steps below:

* Install rembg using pip/pip3 command

```
pip install rembg
```
<br> For CUDA support, use `rembg[gpu]`
<br> For AMD/ROCM support, use `rembg[rocm]`

* Download the models using this script commands:
```python
import rembg

rembg.new_session("model_name") # replace model name with the actual model name
```
* Also write the _model_name_ in the models.txt file (newline)

## 🐞 Debugging

To view plugin logs and troubleshoot issues, open the console through `Fusion page ⮞ Workspace ⮞ Console`. Make sure not to check the `Disable Logging` option in the fuse.

## 🚧 Planned Improvements
- Streamline Python Script Execution on Windows. Eliminate the disruptive console popup by implementing a cleaner method to trigger the processing script. Maybe consider using `comp:DoAction()` or `comp:Execute()` for a more integrated Fusion workflow.

- Optimize Model Reloading and improve overall performance during repeated operations.

- Refactor Image I/O Handling, replace the use of the `Clip()` method with direct image data passing. Maybe consider the `GetPixel()` method.
- Add a python path parameter for fixing python version conflicts.
