3. Paste the folder in the fuse plugin directory of Resolve. [Know How](https://youtube.com/shorts/OFHyc48WOqc?feature=shared)
4. Follow the Rembg setup, either using rembg_manager.py or manually.
5. Open the Fusion page in DaVinci Resolve
6. Search for the Rembg plugin in the node menu (_Shift+Spacebar_)
7. Add the node with any footage
8. Select the model and let the plugin do its work
9. The removed background will be displayed through the media out (if connected)
    
### ‚Æû Automatic Setup for beginners [Rembg_Manager]
An easy-to-use Python script has been developed to simplify the Rembg setup. Just open the setup.py file‚Äîeither directly in Python or via the Fuse interface ‚Äî and follow the installation steps.

<br> If you encounter any error or prefer to manually install Rembg and its models, follow the steps below:

* * Install rembg using pip/pip3 command

```
pip install rembg
```
<br> For CUDA support, use `rembg[gpu]`
<br> For AMD/ROCM support, use `rembg[rocm]`

* * Download the models using this script commands:
```python
import rembg

rembg.new_session("model_name") # replace model name with the actual model name
```
* *  Also write the _model_name_ in the models.txt file (newline)

## üöß Planned Improvements
- Streamline Python Script Execution on Windows Eliminate the disruptive console popup by implementing a cleaner method to trigger the processing script. Maybe consider using `comp:DoAction()` for a more integrated Fusion workflow.

- Optimize Model Reloading and improve overall performance during repeated operations.

- Refactor Image I/O Handling, replace the use of the `Clip()` method with direct image data passing. Maybe consider the `GetPixel()` method.
